## References and Borrowing

The `calculate_length` function takes a reference `&` to an object as a parameter instead of taking ownership of the value:

```rust,ignore
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let len = calculate_length(&s1);

    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

> Values can be dereferenced with the dereference operator `*`

### Mutable References

Data can have at most one mutable reference:

```rust,ignore
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    change(&mut s);
}

fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```

This restriction prevents data races:

- Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.
- At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data.
- There’s no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data.

Creating a new scope with curly brackets allows for multiple mutable references, just not _simultaneous_ ones:

```rust,ignore
let mut s = String::from("hello");

    {
        let r1 = &mut s;
    } // r1 goes out of scope here, so we can make a new reference with no problems.

    let r2 = &mut s;
```

However, you cannot have a a mutable reference while also having an immutable one, unless all immutable references are out of scope:

```rust,ignore
 let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s; // no problem
    let r2 = &s; // no problem
    println!("{} and {}", r1, r2);
    // r1 and r2 are no longer used after this point

    let r3 = &mut s; // no problem
    println!("{}", r3);
```

### Dangling References

The Rust compiler will check for dangling references to values that are out of scope:

```rust,ignore
fn dangle() -> &String { // dangle returns a reference to a String

    let s = String::from("hello"); // s is a new String

    &s // we return a reference to the String, s
} // Here, s goes out of scope, and is dropped. Its memory goes away.
  // Danger!
```
